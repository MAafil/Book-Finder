# Book Finder

This is a web app that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can enter a keyword, title, author, subject, or ISBN number and get a list of matching books.  
The results return the following information:

- Number of pages
- Date published
- Average rating
- Total number of reviews
- Price
- The plot 
- And link to the book on Google.

Users can also filter the results by print type and sort by relevance, total reviews, total pages, average rating, and date published. This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Axios, and Bootstrap.
